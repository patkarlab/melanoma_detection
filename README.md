## General Information
- We are trying to use images to classify skin lesions and to detect melanoma amongst them using AI
- We are using International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Dataset

## Conclusions
- It worked, we can detect melanoma, accuracy of 60 in training and 40% in validation dataset



## Technologies Used
-Keras
-Tensorflow 2.10
